    <h1>Nathan's dank poem about the man from Japan</h1>
     <p>There once was a man from japan who had a lot of ham.
     <br>He lived as best as he can when only had spam.
     <br>He ate green bananas to please his nannas.
     <br>And yellow ones too to help him poo.
     <br>Shamalamadingdong. Scooby Doo I'm coming for you.
